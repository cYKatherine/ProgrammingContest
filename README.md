Algorithm and Data Structure practice on UVa online judge
----------------------------------------------------------

After finishing the `Algorithm and Data structure` unit at uni, I found myself having a great interest in algorithm. Along with participating some competitive programming contests, I decided to further increase my knowledge.

This repository is created to trace my work on solving problems on UVa online judge. The problems will mainly be written in C++ (as a good way to learn C++ as well).

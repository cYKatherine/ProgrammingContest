# Algorithm and Data Structure practice on UVa online judge

After finishing the `Algorithm and Data structure` unit at uni, I found myself having a great interest in algorithm. Along with participating in some competitive programming contests, I decided to further increase my knowledge.

This repository is created to trace my work on solving problems on UVa online judge, codeForces and other programming contest problem sets. The problems will mainly be written in C++ (as a good way to learn C++ as well).
